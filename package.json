  "description": "See the function on line 1. It takes in a letter grade as a  parameter and spits out the value as a grade point. A is 4, B is 3 etc. Run it, switch around letter grade that is passed in on line 7. Play around and see how it works. It doesn't take into account honors or advanced classes, just regular grade points like how it is in college. That function is an abstraction! You could exercise modularity and the DRY ethic by calling it 8 times, once for each of your classes, and then dividing the result by 8. That would be your GPA.",
